#### 1. REPOSITORY STRUCTURE 
The code is structured into distinct files & folders:

#### Submission - [Click](https://github.com/Rupesh707/Duoro_Hawk_Flying_Taxis/tree/Master/submission_data%2Bparameters)

#### Full_Study - [Click](https://github.com/Rupesh707/Duoro_Hawk_Flying_Taxis/blob/Master/Duro_Hawk.ipynb)

#### Duoro_Hawk_Pipeline - [Click](https://github.com/Rupesh707/Duoro_Hawk_Flying_Taxis)
- Images - Output of images from the pipeline
- Esn_class.py - Has general purpose methods which do not rely on a given task
- Esn_loaddata.py - Dataloader
- Esn_mackleyglass.py - Mackey-Glass (Ï„=17) time series for benchmarking
- EsnModelSelection.py - Optimizer for building neural nets
- esnTrainAndTestUtils.py - Helper for train & test
- utils.py - Helper functions


### 2. FINAL RESULTS

- The best parameters found by the grid search are:
Nr = 250 sigma =0.4 lambda =0.01 Leak rate = 1 Connectivity = 30%

The top model after training :
- Validation error of km 1.016 (MHD).
- Train error of km 0.801 (MHD).

The model is trained with the first 2,500 trips and tested over 5,000 following ones.We can also see how the network predicts the destination as the taxi ride goes on, the green points are the predicted destination as we go through the real trajectory (red points). The X stands for the predicted final destination of which we evaluate the Mean Haversine Distance(MHD).

The data would flow from the fleet vehicles to Amazon S3, then to Amazon Kinesis, where it would be processed by Lambda and stored in DynamoDB, also it would be indexed and visualized using Amazon Elasticsearch Service. If certain conditions are met, SNS will send notifications accordingly.

- An extract will be created from the Fleet Management system containing vehicle data and sensor logs.
- Amazong SageMaker model will be deployed after model is trained.
- Connected vehicle sends sensor logs to IoT Core as shown (alternarively via HTTP interface)
- Sensor logs are persisted via Amazon Kinesis
- Sensor logs are sent to Lambda for analysis
- Lambda uses predictions model on sensor logs
- Predictions are persisted in S3
- Aggregate results are displayed on Amazon QuickSight dashboard
- Real-time results are displayed on Amazon QuickSight dashboard
- Amazon SNS sends notifications back to connected vehicle

It's worth mentioning that this is a high-level illustration, specific details and the design of the dataflow could be adjusted based as per specific requirements of the system.
